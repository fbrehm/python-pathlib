Description: set of Python 2 classes to handle filesystem paths
 Pathlib offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths.
 It offers the following advantages over using string objects:
 .
  * No more cumbersome use of os and os.path functions. Everything
    can be done easily through operators, attribute accesses, and method calls.
  * Embodies the semantics of different path types. For example,
    comparing Windows paths ignores casing.
  * Well-defined semantics, eliminating any warts or ambiguities
    (forward vs. backward slashes, etc.).
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
